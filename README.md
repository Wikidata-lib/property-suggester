## Installation

The recommended way to use this library is via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

### Composer

To add this package as a local, per-project dependency to your project, simply add a
dependency on `propertysuggester/propertysuggester` to your project's `composer.json` file.
Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file:

    {
        "require": {
            "propertysuggester/propertysuggester": "*"
        }
    }

### Setup

This extension adds a new table "wbs_propertypairs" that contains the information that is needed to generate
suggestions. You can use [PropertySuggester-Python](https://github.com/Wikidata-lib/PropertySuggester-Python) to
generate this data from a wikidata dump.

* run ```composer dump-autoload``` in the extension folder (if installed without composer)
* add ```require_once "$IP/extensions/PropertySuggester/PropertySuggester.php";``` to your localsettings
* run ```maintenance/update.php``` to create the necessary table
* follow the readme of PropertySuggester-Python to generate and load suggestion data

### Configuration

* $wgPropertySuggesterMinProbability - a float that sets a minimum threshold for suggestions (default 0.05)
* $wgPropertySuggesterDeprecatedIds - a list of ints that blacklist properties
* $wgPropertySuggesterInitialSuggestions - a list of ints that will be suggested when no statements exist
